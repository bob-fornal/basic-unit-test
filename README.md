# The Basic Unit Test

This repository exists to support a presentation I am recording.

1. The `main` branch is the starting point of the talk.
2. There is a branch called `presentation-code` that has the end results of the talk.

## Running Unit Tests

```script
> npm run test-js
```

## Other Functionality

There is a `src-ts` branch that is a playground for working with TypeScript that I will not use in the talk.

Run the TypeScript Unit Tests with ...

```script
> npm run test-js
```

There is also a Complexity Report available that again will not be a part of the talk.

Run the Complexity Report with ...

```script
> npm run complexity-report
```
